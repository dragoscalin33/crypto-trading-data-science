# üöÄ Quantitative Crypto Trading Strategy: Maximizing Profitability with Data Science

## üìÑ Project Overview

This project focuses on the development and backtesting of high-frequency trading strategies for the cryptocurrency market, utilizing a **real historical dataset** of operations. The main objective is to identify and validate entry signals with a high probability of success (`LONG` positions), optimize trade management, and project long-term capital growth potential.

It demonstrates the application of Data Science methodologies to transform complex data into actionable insights and potentially value-generating investment strategies.

**All strategies and underlying data analyzed in this project are derived from the proprietary signals generated by Smart Crypto Signals.** The performance metrics and capital growth projections are based on real historical trade results from these strategies.

## üìà Key Analysis and Results

### 1. Advanced Data Preprocessing

Robust transformation of the nested JSON dataset was performed, normalizing the data for efficient analysis. This step was crucial for unlocking the value contained within the 80+ feature columns.

### 2. Identifying the Most Profitable Entry Strategy (LONG)

After evaluating 16 entry strategies, **`Strategy_1_isOpportunity`** (`isOpportunity == True`) emerged as the top performer for LONG trades.

| Strategy                   | Signals Generated | Completed Trades | Profitable Trades | Win Rate (%) | Avg. Profit (%) | Avg. Loss (%) | Avg. R/R Ratio |
| :------------------------- | :---------------- | :--------------- | :---------------- | :----------- | :-------------- | :------------ | :------------- |
| `Strategy_1_isOpportunity` | 294               | 291              | 174               | **59.79** | **1.30** | -3.99         | 0.33           |
| `Strategy_3_GoodDir_ShouldWork` | 750               | 749              | 427               | 57.01        | 1.28            | -3.83         | 0.33           |
| `Strategy_2_shouldWork`    | 1050              | 1039             | 600               | 57.75        | 1.22            | -3.83         | 0.32           |
| `Strategy_16_TrendConf_High` | 379               | 379              | 206               | 54.35        | 1.21            | -3.91         | 0.31           |
| `Strategy_5_Score2High`    | 589               | 588              | 323               | 54.93        | 1.18            | -3.79         | 0.31           |

*Conclusion*: The `isOpportunity` signal stands out as a high-quality indicator, demonstrating the importance of composite metrics in identifying trades with higher potential.

### 3. Temporal Optimization: The Power of Day and Time

A deep analysis revealed that both the day of the week and the opening time of trades significantly impact the profitability of `Strategy_1_isOpportunity`.

**Average Profit by Day of the Week:**

**Profit Distribution by Day of the Week:**
![Profit Distribution by Day of the Week for Strategy_1_isOpportunity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dragoscalin33/crypto-trading-data-science/main/images/profit_distribution_by_day.png)

*Key Findings by Day*: **Wednesdays and Thursdays** showed superior returns (up to 2.91% average profit and 76.60% win rate on Wednesdays).

**Average Profit by Time of Day (Wednesdays and Thursdays Only):**

*Key Findings by Time*: The detailed analysis of optimal hours **within the top-performing days (Wednesdays and Thursdays)** revealed that, by combining both filters, the strategy achieves an **80.00% Win Rate** and an **Average Profit of 3.55% per trade**. This highlights that identifying "prime time" windows of higher liquidity or market activity is crucial for maximizing the strategy's potential.

### 4. Exit Strategies and Risk Management (Stop Loss / Take Profit)

The dataset integrates predefined `stopLoss` logics and multiple `takeProfit` targets (`tp1`, `tp2`, `tp3`), whose effectiveness is reflected in the `finalProfitPercentage`. While the win rate is solid, the average `Risk/Reward Ratio` indicated a need for future optimizations to improve the magnitude of gains versus losses. However, with the day and time optimized strategy, the **Risk/Reward Ratio improved to 0.97**, which is significantly more favorable.

### 5. 6-Month Capital Growth Simulation: Demonstrating Investment Potential

We projected the growth of an initial capital of **‚Ç¨5,000** over **6 months**, assuming the application of the highly optimized `Strategy_1_isOpportunity` (by day and time of day), and compounded reinvestment of profits.

* **Average Profit per Trade (Optimized Strategy):** 3.55%
* **Estimated Opportunity Frequency:** 20 trades per week
* **Total Simulated Trades over 6 months:** 480
* **Projected Capital (6 months):** Approximately **‚Ç¨92,088,567,120.36**

**6-Month Capital Growth Projection:**

*Important Legal Disclaimer:* This simulation is theoretical and is based on **real historical data and simplified assumptions.** It is not a guarantee of future results and does not account for critical factors of real trading such as: commissions, slippage, **the impact of deploying capital at such a massive scale on market liquidity**, `drawdown` management (temporary capital reductions), and psychological impacts. The frequency of 20 trades per week is a hypothesis to demonstrate the potential of compounding with a significant edge, and not necessarily a reflection of the actual number of signals the strategy currently generates. **While mathematically derived from the average profit per trade, it's crucial to understand that real-world trading at this scale would face immense challenges related to market liquidity and trade execution that are not accounted for in this simplified model. This projection serves as an illustrative demonstration of the power of compound interest, assuming ideal, unconstrained conditions.**

## ‚úÖ Conclusions and Next Steps

This project validates a powerful trading strategy and demonstrates how a Data Science approach can identify investment opportunities and optimize their performance. Integrating the `isOpportunity` signal with temporal filters (by day and time) reveals a clear path towards improving profitability and risk management.

**Future Research Directions:**

* **Deep Dive into `isOpportunity`:** Analyze the underlying components that contribute to the `isOpportunity` signal for a deeper understanding and potential recreation.
* **Robust SL/TP Optimization:** Develop models to dynamically adjust Stop Loss and Take Profit levels, aiming to improve the risk/reward ratio.
* **Expansion to 'SHORT' Strategies:** Apply similar methodologies to identify short-selling opportunities.
* **Advanced Predictive Models:** Implement Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., Time Series, Classification) to predict trade success or price movements.
* **Realistic Portfolio Simulation:** Develop a more sophisticated trading simulator that incorporates capital management, leverage, and the impact of `drawdowns` on account growth.
